Thank you for your time and looking at my project, here are some thoughts/problems I encountered along the way:

1. Migration problem, in trying to create the field validator for the UploadFileModel I kept getting a key error and I couldn't figure out why.
2. I kind of went forward with it anyway, just to try and show that I had an understanding of the task
3. I've never really used Django, so I did my best to piece this together as I could and show that I was at least familiar with it. Not as an excuse, 
just hopefully as an understanding that I had never done Django before (as you could see on my resume)
4. I think this was a pretty straightforward and fair task that I just didn't have the full experience to complete. 
5. I'm confident that I can learn and adapt to the Django framework and how it operates. Its very similar to the MVC model from Rails, which I have some experience in.
